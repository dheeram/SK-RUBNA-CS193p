# Nested Types
* Nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures within the definition of the type they support
* For a NT, write its definition within the outer braces of the type it supports



## Nested Types in Action

```swift
struct BlackjackCard {

    // nested Suit enumeration
    enum Suit: Character {
        case spades = "♠", hearts = "♡", diamonds = "♢", clubs = "♣"
    }

    // nested Rank enumeration
    enum Rank: Int {
        case two = 2, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
        case jack, queen, king, ace
        struct Values {
            let first: Int, second: Int?
        }
        var values: Values {
            ...
        }
    }

    // BlackjackCard properties and methods
    let rank: Rank, suit: Suit
    var description: String {
       ...
    }
}
```
